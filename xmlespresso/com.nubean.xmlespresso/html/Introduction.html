<h1>XMLEspresso 6.0.0 Eclipse Plugin</h1>
<h2>What is new in version 6.0.0?</h2>
<p>The following features are new in version 6.0.0:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Version 6.0.0 supports editing of DTD and CSS documents.</li>
  <li>The default edit mode in XML document source view is Text Mode
    with complete support for intelligent content assist, free-form editing,
    automatic background parsing, and well-formed document error reporting. </li>
  <li>XML Mode with
       restricted editing capabilities is also available. We recommend Text Mode
      for normal editing during development; XML Mode is ideal for lock down
    editing during change control.</li>
  <li>The intelligent content assist algorithms have been made smarter
    and easier to use. For example, if multiple required sub-elements are missing,
    content assist will show only the next required element that is missing.</li>
  <li>You can add new name space qualified schema locations (http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/#xsi_schemaLocation)
    within the document on the fly and those schemas will be automatically added
    to the document schemas, after your refresh the document.</li>
  <li>Many new entries in the builit-in catalog, including JavaEE 5 documents.</li>
  <li>Improved user interface.</li>
</ul>
