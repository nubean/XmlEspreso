<h2>
3.0 Introduction</h2>

<p>A document is any XML document with file extension type of <b>.xml</b>, <b>.xslt</b>, <b>.xsd</b>,
or <b>.tld</b> . A document of file extension type <b>.xml</b> is an Extensible
Markup Language document. A document of file extension type
<b>.xslt</b>
is an Extensible Stylesheet Language document. A document of type <b>.xsd</b>
is a W3C XML Schema document. A document of file extension type <b>.tld</b> is a 
J2EE Tag Library Descriptor document. 
<P>A new document is created by selecting a document
from a catalog of document types. The catalog has document templates
for J2EE, XSLT, W3C Schema, Apache Ant, Xhtml, JSF, Hibernate, Apache Tiles, and Apache Struts  Schema documents. 
When a document type is selected, a DTD or/and a W3C Schema is specified
for the document. A DTD document may also be created by selecting XMLEspresso>DTD in New>Select a wizard. A CSS document may be created by selecting XMLEspresso>CSS 2.1. 
<P>
A new document can be edited in the Source mode or
the Design mode. A new document is constructed by adding elements to the
document. A choice list of elements in the Source mode and a node
panel of elements in the Design mode provide a selection of sub-elements
to add to an element.
